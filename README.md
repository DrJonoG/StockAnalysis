# StockAnalysis
Over time I will be adding a series of functions to manipulate and analyse stock data to help support your trading strategies.

- TickerDownload.py:
  Automatically download stocks from the Yahoo financial pages saving as a CSV
- TickerIndicators.py
  Computation of simple indicators on data extracted from Yahoo. Including moving averages, bollinger bands and VWAP. More to come soon.
