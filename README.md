Python module to get stock data from the Alpha Vantage and Yahoo API

Alpha Vantage delivers a free API for real time financial data and most used finance indicators in a simple json or pandas format. This module implements a python interface to the free API provided by Alpha Vantage. It requires a free API key, that can be requested from http://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key.
